# Podcast Dashboard

Welcome to the Podcast Dashboard, a comprehensive application I am building from design to development and production, spanning the entire tech stack. This project is an ambitious venture that combines my passion for programming with my obsession for studying foreign languages through podcasts.

## Motivation

As a software engineer, I am driven by the desire to explore, learn, and build. This application is giving me the opportunity to delve into each phase of the software development lifecycle and handle both frontend and backend technologies, as well as data engineering.

In addition to being a personal growth project, Podcast Dashboard serves a practical purpose: to aggregate all the podcasts I listen to for language learning. Podcasts are a vital tool in my language studies, offering an accessible, engaging way to improve listening skills and cultural knowledge. However, keeping track of numerous podcasts across multiple languages and sources can be challenging, so I created this application to streamline that process.

## Structure and Technologies

Podcast Dashboard's tech stack spans across several modern and efficient technologies:

* Frontend: Built using Next.js, a powerful React framework for production-grade applications, and styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

* Backend: Developed using Django and Django REST Framework. Django is a high-level Python web framework encouraging rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django REST Framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

* Database: PostgreSQL, an open-source, powerful, open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language.

* Web Scraper: Built with Scrapy, an open-source, collaborative web crawling framework for Python.

* Containerization: The application is dockerized to ensure it runs uniformly across different systems and environments.

## Roadmap

The Podcast Dashboard project is continually evolving, with plans for additional features and enhancements. I aim to make this application more intuitive and useful for individuals who, like me, are using podcasts as a language-learning tool.

## Contributing

While this project is primarily a personal undertaking, constructive feedback and suggestions are always welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
Conclusion

Podcast Dashboard is a labor of love, a testament to my passion for programming and language learning. It represents an important step in my journey as a full-stack developer.
